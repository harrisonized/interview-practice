# Questions

1. How is a binary search tree implemented?

##### Easy

1. How do you perform an inorder traversal in a given binary tree?
2. How do you perform preorder traversal in a given binary tree?
3. How do you implement a postorder traversal algorithm?
4. How are all leaves of a binary search tree printed?
5. How do you count a number of leaf nodes in a given binary tree?

##### Medium

1. How do you print all nodes of a given binary tree using inorder traversal without recursion?
2. How do you traverse a given binary tree in preorder without recursion?
3. How do you traverse a binary tree in postorder traversal without recursion?
4. How do you perform a binary search in a given array?

##### Hard

1. How do you balance a binary tree?  (maybe traverse inorder and insert into a new tree?)
